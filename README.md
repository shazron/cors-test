Simple express server to test CORS.

Adjust the values accordingly in the `index.js/cors` function.


Install then run:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Runs an express server on port 8000.


To test, go to:
https://shazron.github.io/cors-test

... which will attempt to POST to your local server. The source code for it is in the `docs` sub-folder.
